Hey! I’m **Saket Sharma**, a Computer Science & Statistics student at the **University of Toronto (UTM)**.  
I’m passionate about building tools that make people’s lives easier — from productivity apps to AI systems that solve real-world problems.

Contact me: saketshar04@gmail.com

Over the past few years, I’ve:
- 🧩 Conducted **research at the University of Toronto** on complexity and organized behaviour  
- ⚛️ Explored **quantum computing** with student researchers at the **University of Waterloo**  
- 🏆 Won **1st Place in the CAIC (Canadian AI Competition)** 
- 💡 Co-founded **SOAPure**, a startup (Discontinued)
- 💻 Built and led multiple projects at **hackathons across North America**

I love blending **technology, creativity, and community** — whether that’s through code, entrepreneurship, or mentoring other students.

When I’m not coding, I’m probably reading a **Freida McFadden thriller**, sketching out new app ideas, or planning my next big project.
